# piles

_making sense of your piles of files_

piles is a script to display the file sizes of the folders and files in a given
directory. This is useful to get a sense of which folders/files take up the
most space.

piles is written with compatibility in mind. It should work with most shells (bash, zsh, dash, heirloom, etc).


### Usage
Run ```piles``` to display the folders/files in the directory, or ```piles DIR``` to show the folders/files in DIR.

The optional ```-n``` flag allows you to change the number of folders/files displayed.

```piles -n 5``` will display only the top 5 folders/files.

Do whatever you want with it!
